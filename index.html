  <p>The Mega Knight card is unlocked from Royal Arena (Arena 7) or a Legendary Chest. He is a melee-ranged splash damage troop with very high hitpoints and moderate splash damage. He appears with black spiked fists and armor, along with grey chainmail and a team-colored belt.</p>
  </div>
  <section class="cards" id="s1">
      <h1>Mega Knight</h1>
      <p>His spawn damage is similar to a Fireball, which makes him useful for quickly defeating cards with similar health to a Musketeer or Wizard. He will then only require 1 more regular attack to defeat them fully. However, the Night Witch, Witch, and Bandit have slightly more health than these units, so he will require a second swing to finish them off.
        The Mega Knight's high spawn damage and very high hitpoints make him nearly impossible to defeat on the opposing side. He can get enormous value against massive pushes because of this.
        The Mega Knight works well with the Inferno Dragon, as they compliment each other's weakness. Mega Knight can take out ranged glass weapons and swarms that counter the Inferno Dragon. The Inferno Dragon in turn can roast through tanks Mega Knight would struggle to deal enough damage to. However, it can be somewhat countered by air swarms so be sure to bring spells to deal with them.
        A similar strategy is to combine Mega Knight & P.E.K.K.A. in a push, as they also counter each otherâ€™s weaknesses. While it can be more threatening, it is extremely expensive at 14 Elixir, often requiring that 1 of them be used on defense beforehand, which can whittle down their hitpoints. It is also even weaker to air units.</p>
  </section>

  <div class="legendary" id="i2">
  <p>The Sparky card is unlocked from Electro Valley (Arena 11) or a Legendary Chest. It is a ranged area damage troop with moderately high hitpoints and extremely high area damage. It takes the appearance a front-facing tesla coil with an attached steel ram and a base with 4 wooden wheels.</p>
  </div>

  <section class="cards" id="s2">
  <h1>Sparky</h1>
  <p>Due to its massive damage, Sparky is capable of taking out high hitpoint troops such as the Giant and Royal Giant in just a few hits.
    Electro Wizard, Electro Dragon, and Zappies are very reliable counters to the Sparky, being able to permanently stun it until its destroyed for a positive Elixir trade.
    The Sparky is most effectively used in counterattacking, being able to decimate entire pushes for large Elixir trades thanks to it's attack's high area damage and radius. Its slow attacking and movement speed leaves it vulnerable on offense when its is alone, and its high 6 Elixir cost will leave the player at a deficit for some time.
    Players can also use Sparky to counter the P.E.K.K.A. However, if the P.E.K.K.A is at least two levels higher than Sparky, it could be risky as the P.E.K.K.A will survive 2 blasts from her and eventually destroy Sparky due to her very high damage and hitpoints.
    Because Sparky deals immense damage but can be easily countered, she is best used as a support troop, ideally behind a high hitpoint tank that targets buildings like the Golem or Giant. Having the tank target buildings means that it will separate itself from the Sparky when units are deployed to defend, making it more difficult for the opponent to hit them both with area damage cards.</p>

  <div class="legendary" id="i3">
  <p>The Princess card is unlocked from the Spell Valley (Arena 5) or a Legendary Chest. She is an area-damaging, long-ranged troop with low hitpoints and moderate splash damage. Her long range allows her to target and attack Princess Towers from the opposite side of the river.</p>
  </div>

  <section class="cards" id="s3">
  <h1>Princess</h1>
  <p>Due to her splash damage and long range, Princess is a strong support or siege unit. However, she does moderate damage which coupled with her very slow attack rate makes her a weak solo counter to anything but swarms. Zap is an excellent synergy with Princess as together they can instantly take out Minion Hordes and Goblins.
    A good method of getting some early chip damage on the opponent's tower is to deploy her at the bridge at the start of the match if she appears in the player's starting hand. She will start shooting at the tower. This is extremely hard to react to and will often catch their opponent off guard.
    The defender should be aware of when the opponent has a Princess in their hand and cycle their cards in the center of the arena to increase their odds of catching a Princess' sight as it is deployed.
    Skeletons are the cheapest counter to a distracted Princess at the bridge. They can be spelled away on reaction before she even gets hit once, allowing the Princess to provide more value, but almost any response to the Skeletons will be a negative Elixir trade since they cost just 1 Elixir, in addition to the Princess' 3 Elixir cost. This can give the player a decent Elixir advantage at the cost of some tower damage, and also potentially bait a spell out of the opponent.</p>

  <div class="legendary" id="i4">
  <p>The Log card is unlocked from the Builder's Workshop (Arena 6) or a Legendary Chest. It is an area damage spell that affects a rectangular area on the ground as it rolls through its targets, damaging them and pushing any survivors back. It disintegrates after rolling for 10.1 tiles.</p>
  </div>

  <section class="cards" id="s4">
      <h1>Log</h1>
      <p>As a cheap spell, The Log can be used to damage and push back multiple ground troops that are approaching your side, such as Barbarians or Goblins.
        Unlike all other cards with a pushback effect, The Log can affect all ground troops. If a troop is locked into a target, the pushback caused by The Log will reset their attack animation. This is in contrast with the Zap or Lightning, as it will only pause the attack instead of fully resetting it, with the exception of Sparky.
        It can be a cheaper alternative to Arrows, due to the very similar damage and area of effect.
        The main differences are that The Log costs one less Elixir while being unable to affect air troops. As such, it might be advisable to bring other splash damage cards to deal with the likes of Minions and the Minion Horde.
        It can also be an alternative to Zap, as both of them have the same Elixir cost. They can both disarm the charge attacks of Prince and Dark Prince if you have low Elixir or if your small units are out of rotation. However, they have slightly different effects when used. The Log will not reset a Sparky, but a Zap will.
